    "This project aims to use a machine learning model to predict and identify sources of air pollution southeast Asian cities. Because this is a multi-variables problem with complex interaction among features, and time-lag, a machine learning approach has an advantage over a traditional approach. In this study, a random forest regressor(RF) is used to model a small particle pollution(PM2.5) level. After trying to search for various machine learning models, I found that RF performs the best. Besides, the model can be easily interpreted. The model's feature of importances in a combination of data exploration helps identify the major sources of air pollution. The trained model is used to simulate the pollution level when environmental policies are implemented. Here, I provide a case study for Chiang Mai, but the codes work with other cities such as Bangkok, and Hanoi (Given there is enough data, of course!)\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain how to use my code to analyze the air pollution, I first explain the [packages](#Requirements-2) I used and the [directory tree](#Directory-Tree-3). Then I will describe how to obtain [data](#Data-Sources-4). [AQI convention](#AQI-Convention-5) section explains the color label used in this study. [An Analysis for Chiang Mai](#Modeling-Air-Pollution-in-Chiang-Mai-Data-:-A-Case-Study-6) is split into [Exploring the data](Exploratory-Data-Analysis-6.3), [model optimization](Model-Optimization-6.4), and [simulation](#Simulation-6.5). I will include result figures and the code I used to generate the figures if applicable. The analysis results for Chiang Mai is summarized in the [conclusions](#Conclusions-8) \n"

My simulation shows that even with a drastic reduction to 10% of the original value in the 0 - 100 km zone could only reduce the peak pollution level down to around 70 $\\mu g/m^3$(blue line), still unhealthy AQI. The reason for the minuscule pollution reduction when reducing only the activities in the 100 km zone is because the burning activities in the outer zones occur in much larger as shown in Figure 10. During the peak of the pollution season, there are about 35 hotspots per day, which is a much smaller amount compared to 900 in the other zones. This means tackling the burning activity within a 100 km zone is not sufficient and reducing the burning has to be done in a wider area.\n",

    "It might be counter-intuitive why 10% of the burning activities still cannot result in good air quality range. This is not due to the bias in the model, but because 10% is still a lot of burning activities in the area. For example, during the peak of the pollution season in March, there are a large amount of the burning activities in the 200-400, 400-700, 700-1000 km zones. With 10% of the original burning activities, there are still about 80 hotspots/day on average.

    "I study the sources of the air pollution problem in Chiang Mai. The major problem is from the high AQI of PM2.5 pollution. The PM2.5 level has a seasonal pattern with value exceed the moderate AQI between December-April and often exceeds unhealthy AQI in March. Other pollutants such as PM10 and O¬3, also exhibit similar seasonal patterns but with peak AQIs still in the moderate range. By inspecting the seasonal pattern of the pollution level, I rule out traffic, industrial activities, and power plants from the possible sources of air pollution and identify that agricultural burning as the major source. The number of burning hotspots seen from the MODIS satellite has the same seasonal pattern as that of the PM2.5 level. Moreover, in the years with abnormally low burning activities correspond to those with lower pollution levels. The number of burning activities and thus the pollution level is not a result of climate change because of their decreasing yearly trends, which is opposite to the increasing temperature trend. \n",
    "\n",
    "To quantify the effect of the burning activities toward the PM2.5 level, I trained a random forest regressor to predict the hourly PM2.5 level with the weather, hotspots within 1000 km from Chiang Mai, and auxiliary date-time information as a tabular input. The hotspots data are divided into distance-based zones to measure the effect of each zone. The model achieved a 0.70 R2-score for hourly values in the 3 recent years of unseen dataset, and 0.78 R2-score when considering the daily average values. As expected, the model order of importance ranks the hotspots columns as the tops with the first in 100-200 km zone as most important. The trained model is used to simulate a range of possible pollution levels using the historical input values in the training dataset. The average pollution level has correct seasonal patterns and values as the data in the unseen dataset. The simulated pollution levels under different scenarios with reduced burning activities. The simulation shows that reducing the burning activities within the Thailand border (100 km area from Chiang Mai) alone could not lower to PM2.5 level from the unhealthy AQI, and aggressive reduction in the area covered as far a 1000 km is needed. \n"
